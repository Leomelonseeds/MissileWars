A new, fresh installment of the classic gamemode made by Cubehamster and Sethbling, where slimeblock TNT flying machines are used to bust through enemy shields and blow up their nether portals. Join with your friends now at play.ultimamc.net

All the original, best features of Missile Wars are here - but with 4 customizable classes or decks, 40+ different missiles, 20+ new maps, and a whole host of gameplay additions and improvements, you won't be forgetting this version any time soon.

*Do not try to compile and use this plugin on your own server. It will not work.*

## Decks
There are now 4 different Decks (kits), each with 5 different missiles, 3 unique utility items, and its own weapon:
* **Vanguard** - A speed-focused deck that contains the fastest missiles in the game, in addition to (nerfed) mobility items like the Canopy and Splash. Includes a gold sword that can be upgraded with sharpness and fire aspect.
* **Berserker** - With all the most explosive missiles, you don't want a Berserker getting to your side. Utilities include creepers and fireballs, and a handy crossbow with multishot, quick charge, and sharpness available.
* **Sentinel** - A defense specialist, with sturdy missiles and utility items like the sky-mine torpedo and obsidian shield. Includes a flame bow that can be enchanted with sharpness and punch.
* **Architect** - If constructing infrastructure is your thing, the special missiles, shields, platforms, and leaves offered by this deck will suit your playstyle. Has an iron pickaxe that can be upgraded with sharpness, efficiency, and a custom haste enchantment.

Each deck can be upgraded and customized to your liking, with up to 3 custom presets available, and by default 18 skillpoints per preset. Change the power of your missiles, the defensive capability of your utility items, the level of your enchantments, and add passives that change your gameplay and rng. The possibilities are pretty much endless.

Hours have been spent balancing each item and passive. Any build you can come up with may be just as viable as the next. Counter strong builds with ones of your own, and find strategies to master the use of each deck.

## Items
The decks include over 35 new unique missiles (most credited to the Rocket Riders team!) and utility items, making gameplay more fun and interesting, offering many new strategies and possibilities for team collaboration. Below are some new utility items:
* **Torpedo** - A block-based sky mine that explodes on contact with missiles and players
* **Canopy** - A nerfed version of the Rocket Riders canopy that requires a player to be on the ground to use, and only teleports after 1 second.
* **Platform** - Rotate a shield 90 degrees, and you get a perfect space to party
* **Leaves** - Temporary building blocks that decay after a while
* **Obsidian Shield** - A pretty strong shield that will disappear after a few seconds
* **Fireball** - Point and click firing mechanism, instead of placing on ground
* **Lingering Harming Potion**
* **Spawn Creeper**

## New Maps
20+ new maps, each changing the gameplay in fun and inventive ways, have been added. Up to 8 maps are available at one time and rotate weekly, while new maps are constantly being worked on.

## Gameplay & QOL
Here are just a few of the most important features that you might not have seen before.
* Per-item cooldowns - each item has its own cooldown and max items, removing almost all RNG associated with the game.

* You now need to blow up *all* enemy portals to win (and there can be many :).
* A tracker system associates portal breaks and kills from TNT to yourself. Blocked a missile with a shield or your own missile? That's your kill. Sniped someone with a Slingshot missile? That's your kill.
* A rankup and stats system has been added. Gain more skillpoints with each rankup to use in your decks, and climb the leaderboards.
* A 30 minute game timer, after which the team with the most portals remaining wins. Chaos mode starts when there are 10 minutes remaining, with halved item cooldowns.
* Cooldowns in 1v2s and 2v3s adjust to 1/2 and 2/3 of their normal times respectively to balance unfair teams.
* A particle preview of the location of a spawnable missile.
* A cooldown of 0.4 seconds between each missile spawn.
* Auto-queue into the next game after the current game ends.
* Use /votemap to pick your favorite map.
* Use /settings to customize your queueing options.

## Roadmap
Why stop here? Missile Wars is in active development. Here are the features I have planned out:
* New gamemode: Capture the Flag
* New gamemode: Domination
* Private games with custom settings (creatable by ROYAL rank players only)
* Achievements, many new cosmetics, QOL improvements
