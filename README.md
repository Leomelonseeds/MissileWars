A new, fresh installment of the classic gamemode made by Cubehamster and Sethbling, where slimeblock TNT flying machines are used to bust through enemy shields and blow up their nether portals. Join with your friends now at **play.ultimamc.net**

All the original, best features of Missile Wars are here - but with 4 customizable classes or decks, 40+ different missiles, 25+ new maps, 18 new abilities and passives, and a whole host of gameplay additions and improvements, you won't be forgetting this version any time soon.

*Do not try to compile and use this plugin on your own server. It will not work.*

## Decks
There are now 4 different Decks (kits), each with 5 different missiles, 3 unique utility items, and its own weapon:
* **Vanguard** - A speed-focused deck that contains the fastest missiles in the game, in addition to mobility items like the Canopy and Splash. Includes a gold sword that can be upgraded with sharpness and fire aspect.
* **Berserker** - With all the most explosive missiles, you don't want a Berserker getting to your side. Utilities include creepers and fireballs, and a handy crossbow with multishot, quick charge, and sharpness available.
* **Sentinel** - A defense specialist, with sturdy missiles and utility items like the sky-mine torpedo and obsidian shield. Includes a bow that can be enchanted with flame and sharpness.
* **Architect** - If constructing infrastructure is your thing, the special missiles, shields, platforms, and leaves offered by this deck will suit your playstyle. Has an iron pickaxe that can be upgraded with sharpness and efficiency.

Each deck can be upgraded and customized to your liking, with up to 3 custom presets available, and by default 20 skillpoints per preset. Change the power of your missiles, the defensive capability of your utility items, the level of your enchantments, and add special abilities and passives to spice up your gameplay. The possibilities are pretty much endless. Here's some examples of abilities:
* **Triton** (Vanguard) - Throw a Splash on yourself to transform your sword into a one-use Trident. The Trident inherits your sword's enchantments, and lights TNT on fire if you have fire aspect.
* **Molotov Splash** (Vanguard) - Convert your Splashes to spawn lava and ignite TNT instead of spawning water.
* **Astral Turret** (Sentinel) - Your Obsidian Shields turn into remote turrets - any projectiles that you throw or shoot will now originate from the turret with the same direction and velocity.
* **Hitchhiker's Bow** (Sentinel) - Hold throwables in your offhand and fire your bow to fire the throwables instead of arrows.
* **Creepershot** (Berserker) - Allows you to load creepers as projectiles into your crossbow and fire them at enemies.
* **Blazeballs** (Berserker) - Use a fireball to load in small, blaze fireballs into your crossbow.
* **Kingsman's Bludgers** (Architect) - Thrown eggs and snowballs do knockback to enemies, and are given back on a successful hit. Additionally, shields and platforms can be spawned any time after thrown by left clicking.
* **Engineer** (Architect) - Collect missile related blocks in your inventory by mining enemy missiles. You can then use these blocks to create new structures, and save them to any missile or throwable to spawn your custom structure instead of their original structure.

Hours have been spent balancing each item, passive, and ability. Any build you can come up with may be just as viable as the next. Counter strong builds with ones of your own, and find strategies to master the use of each deck.

## Items
Instead of randomly being given items, all items now have their own individual cooldowns, removing almost all RNG from the game. At the start of the game, all missiles are given a random offset so gameplay can start smoothly. This offset is the same for every player, ensuring a fair start:

The decks include over 35 new unique missiles (most credited to the Rocket Riders team!) and utility items, making gameplay more fun and interesting, offering many new strategies and possibilities for team collaboration. Below are some new utility items:
* **Torpedo** - A block-based sky mine that explodes on contact with missiles and players.
* **Canopy** - A nerfed version of the Rocket Riders canopy that throws an eye of ender, and teleports after 3 seconds.
* **Platform** - Rotate a shield 90 degrees, and you get a perfect space to party.
* **Leaves** - Temporary building blocks that decay after a while.
* **Obsidian Shield** - A pretty strong shield that will disappear after a few seconds.
* **Fireball** - Point and click firing mechanism, instead of placing on ground.
* **Dragon Fireball** - Spawns a spherical (instead of circular) AOE damage ball at the hit location. Unlike Vanilla, these are deflectable.
* **Spawn Creeper**

## New Maps
25+ new maps, each changing the gameplay in fun and inventive ways, have been added. Up to 8 maps are available at one time and rotate weekly, while new maps are constantly being worked on. Most of the maps are made by Lizzem, huge props to her!

With maps varying in gameplay difficulty, each map has been given a minimum rank requirement that the lobby must meet in order to play on it, giving players incentive to level up, and easing new players into the game.

## Gameplay & QOL
Here are just a few of the most important features that you might not have seen before.
* A full client-side preview of missiles you are about to spawn using display entities:
  <img width="2560" height="1441" alt="2025-09-13_19 40 02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94b0c90b-8521-44f8-a5b1-df6d04be741f" />

* You now need to blow up *all* enemy portals to win (and there can be many :).
* A tracker system associates portal breaks and kills from TNT to yourself. Blocked a missile with a shield or your own missile? That's your kill. Sniped someone with a Slingshot missile? That's your kill.
* A rankup and stats system has been added. Climb the leaderboards, and unlock new maps and cosmetics.
* A 30 minute game timer, after which the team with the most portals remaining wins. At 20 minutes left, item cooldowns are reduced by 25%, and at 10 minutes, they are reduced by 50%.
* Cooldowns in 1v2s and 2v3s adjust to 1/2 and 2/3 of their normal times respectively to balance unfair teams.
* A cooldown of 0.4 seconds between each missile spawn.
* Auto-queue into the next game after the current game ends.
* Use /votemap to pick your favorite map.
* Custom netcode allows high ping players to break blocks and move smoothly on missiles, and deflect fireballs.
* Use /settings to customize options such as queueing, ping fixes, or spawning offsets.

## Roadmap
Why stop here? Missile Wars is in active development. Here are the features I have planned out:
* New gamemode: Capture the Flag

* Private games with custom settings (creatable by ROYAL rank players only)
